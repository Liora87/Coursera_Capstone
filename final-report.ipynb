            "source": " Nowadays people mostly resort to going to malls or big retail chains to purchase their daily stuff. The advantage of going to big retail chains is that one gets all their necessary items just at one place. From groceries to clothes, from sportsequipment\u2019s to stationaries \u2026You name it and you get it!!! Also big hotels, cafe, pubs are one of the most important customers of the retail chains because they purchase their goods in bulk. So, I am aiming to develop a recommender system for these retail outlet chains which would give them a good strategic location for them to open their outlets and make a good profit.\n\nStrategic Location is one of the most important factor for any business to succeed. If the location is bad, no matter how much we invest the business wouldn\u2019t be making any profits. Recently one of the biggest retail chains Walmart decided to close 269stores because it was resulting in a loss. Such a mass closure doesn\u2019t affect only the retail chain shareholders but also affect the employment and lives of the people working in such stores. It was estimated that 16,000 people were affected due to the mass closure. This is a very good example which strengthens the claim that \u2018Location is one of the most important aspect for any business to succeed\u2019.\n\nHence this recommender system will help these retail chains to analyze whether opening a store in that location would be a good decision or not. Foursquare API would be used to gather essential details of how cafes may, hotels. shops are their giving them some knowledge about their potential customers.",

Python\u2019s Geopy module is used to get the latitude and the longitude information. Folium centers the map taking in account the latitude and longitude information.\n\nWe can view all of the neighborhoods in the Borough by calling folium\u2019s Map function. The Foursquare API is then used to get the location information of the different neighborhood and is used to get the most common venues of each neighborhood .The next task would be to group the similar neighborhood together so it will be easy for the retail chains to decide which location would be the best considering the cafes , coffee shops, hotels ,pubs in that neighborhood.\n\nThe machine learning algorithm which would be used to group the similar neighborhood is the Kmeans algorithm from sklearn Cluster library. Kmeans is a very effective algorithm which groups similar data points into one cluster and dissimilar data into other clusters. Considering the similarity of the venues in each neighborhood Kmeans groups them into different clusters. We can then access individual clusters to get the knowledge about the type of potential customers and venues in each neighborhood which would help the retails stores to choose the best strategic location for their business.",
